# My Personal Website

This is a simple, single-page website to display my resume.

It is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to Update

1.  Replace the `assets/resume_en.pdf` and `assets/resume_ru.pdf` files with the new versions of your resume.
2.  Commit and push the changes to the `master` branch.

## Internationalization

The site supports English (EN) and Russian (RU) versions of the resume. Use the language buttons on the page to switch between them. The selected language preference is saved in your browser's local storage.
